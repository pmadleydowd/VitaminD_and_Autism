****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
* This template is based on that used by the data buddy team and they include a number of variables by default.
* To ensure the file works we suggest you keep those in and just add any relevant variables that you need for your project.
* To add data other than that included by default you will need to add the relvant files and pathnames in each of the match commands below.
* There is a separate command for mothers questionnaires, mothers clinics, partner, mothers providing data on the child and data provided by the child themselves.
* Each has different withdrawal of consent issues so they must be considered separately.
* You will need to replace 'YOUR PATHNAME' in each section with your working directory pathname.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.

* Mother questionnaire files - in this section the following file types need to be placed:
* Mother completed Qs about herself
* Maternal grandparents social class
* Partner_proxy social class

* ALWAYS KEEP THIS SECTION IF YOU ARE USING MOTHER-BASED DATA EVEN IF ONLY MOTHER CLINIC REQUESTED
